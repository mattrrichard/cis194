To learn Haskell, I'm working through the
[U Penn CIS 194 (Spring 2013)](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/)
Haskell course.

I _am_ just learning Haskell so my solutions will invariably have bad style
or simply could be done in a more readalbe or concise way.  Please feel free to
contact me or PR with improvements!

<sup>(Who am I kidding? No one will ever read this)</sup>
